UDP Job Processing Server.

The concept is to have a server listening for UDP events.  If an event is received,
events are polled, otherwise the server will sleep for a variable amount of time 
dependent on the most recent frequency of incoming job requests.


The configuration file uses YAML and jobs can be written in Ruby.
